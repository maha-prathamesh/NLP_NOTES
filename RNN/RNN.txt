Y not CNN / RNN comes in picture?
	- No memory element.
	- Present data is not dependent on previous data.

speech,audio,text
	
RNN:
Types:
	1) seq to seq
	2) seq to vector [Sentiment analysis]
	3) vector to sequence [Image captioning]
	4) ennoder and decoder [Language translation]

How to solve:
1) Unroll input sequence over time.
2) Create copy of RNN for each input.
3) Calculate derivative for each copy seperatly.
4) Roll them back by summing up the gradient back to candidate weight update.
